- [x] Development environment configured: React Native 0.81.4, Expo SDK 54.0.13, TypeScript 5.9.2, Node.js managed via Volta.
- [x] Code quality infrastructure configured: ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged.
- [x] Documentation suite completed: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md:1), [`docs/TECHNOLOGIES.md`](docs/TECHNOLOGIES.md:1), [`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md:1), [`docs/SETUP.md`](docs/SETUP.md:1), [`README.md`](README.md:1).
- [x] Storybook integrated with component examples and configuration ([`.storybook/*`](.storybook/:1), [`src/components/*`](src/components/:1)).
- [x] VS Code extensions and EditorConfig configured ([`.vscode/extensions.json`](.vscode/extensions.json:1), [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig:1)).

## What is being done

- [-] Core application initial development: basic Expo starter template and component scaffolding.
- [-] Implementing atomic component structure and meditation timer functionality.
- [-] Investigating TypeScript declaration error related to `eslint-config-expo/flat`.

## What remains / To do

- [ ] Implement meditation timer with customizable durations and session progress tracking.
- [ ] Build user preferences/settings and basic meditation statistics.
- [ ] Integrate styling systems: NativeWind and Tamagui; implement responsive design and accessibility.
- [ ] Implement advanced features: push notifications, social features, analytics, and health platform integrations.
- [ ] Develop testing and QA coverage: unit tests, integration tests, cross-platform testing, and performance testing.

## Open questions

- [ ] Resolve TypeScript declaration error for `eslint-config-expo/flat`.
- [ ] Replace SECURITY.md contact placeholder `<replace-with-security-contact>` in [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md:1).

## Possible next steps

- [ ] Set up atomic design component structure and navigation scaffolding.
- [ ] Implement meditation timer and integrate state management (Context API).
- [ ] Integrate NativeWind and Tamagui styling systems with existing components.
- [ ] Create unit and integration tests for core components and user flows.
