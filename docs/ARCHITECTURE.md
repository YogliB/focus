# Architecture

## Overview

This meditation application follows a modern, component-based architecture designed for simplicity and maintainability. The app focuses on providing a clean, distraction-free meditation experience while ensuring code quality and developer productivity.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Component-Based Design

- **Atomic Design Methodology**: Components are organized following atomic design principles with five distinct levels:
    - **Atoms**: Basic building blocks that can't be broken down further (Button, Text, Icon, Input)
    - **Molecules**: Simple combinations of atoms that form functional units (Timer, ProgressBar, MeditationCard)
    - **Organisms**: Complex UI components that combine molecules (MeditationSession, SettingsPanel, StatisticsView)
    - **Templates**: Page-level layouts that define content structure (HomeScreen, SessionScreen, ProfileScreen)
    - **Pages**: Specific instances of templates with real content and data
- **Reusability**: Shared components reduce code duplication and ensure consistency across meditation features
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility focused on meditation functionality
- **Scalability**: New meditation features can be built by combining existing atomic components

### 2. State Management

- **Local State**: React hooks for component-specific state
- **Global State**: Context API for app-wide settings (theme, user preferences)
- **Server State**: Minimal external API calls for content updates

### 3. Styling Architecture

- **Utility-First CSS**: NativeWind provides utility classes for rapid styling
- **Design System**: Tamagui ensures consistent theming and component variants
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts

## Atomic Design Benefits for Meditation App

The Atomic Design methodology provides specific advantages for this meditation application:

### Development Efficiency

- **Rapid Feature Development**: New meditation features can be built by assembling existing atoms and molecules
- **Consistent User Experience**: Unified design language across all meditation interfaces
- **Easy Maintenance**: Changes to basic components (atoms) automatically propagate to all meditation features

### Meditation-Focused Design

- **Distraction-Free Components**: Each atomic component is designed to support focused meditation experiences
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Complex meditation features are built from simple, tested building blocks
- **Accessibility First**: Atomic components include proper labeling and screen reader support from the start

### Team Collaboration

- **Clear Component Boundaries**: Developers can work on meditation features independently without conflicts
- **Design System Consistency**: Designers and developers share the same component vocabulary
- **Scalable Architecture**: New meditation techniques and features can be added without restructuring

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. React Native + Expo

- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Single codebase for iOS and Android
- **Rapid development**: Expo's managed workflow reduces build complexity
- **Over-the-air updates**: Easy app updates without store submissions

### 2. TypeScript

- **Type safety**: Reduces runtime errors and improves developer experience
- **Better IDE support**: Enhanced autocomplete and refactoring capabilities
- **Self-documenting code**: Types serve as inline documentation

### 3. NativeWind + Tamagui

- **Consistent styling**: Unified approach to styling across platforms
- **Performance**: Optimized for React Native's rendering model
- **Developer experience**: Familiar CSS-like syntax with design system benefits

### 4. Code Quality Tools

- **ESLint + Prettier**: Automated code formatting and linting
- **Husky + lint-staged**: Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality
- **Consistent code style**: Reduces cognitive load for developers

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User interacts with meditation timer or settings
2. **State Updates**: Local state updates trigger re-renders
3. **Persistence**: User preferences saved to AsyncStorage
4. **UI Updates**: Styled components reflect current state

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Screens loaded on-demand to reduce initial bundle size
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo for expensive computations
- **Image Optimization**: Proper sizing and caching for meditation content
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Efficient state management to prevent unnecessary updates

## Accessibility

- **Screen reader support**: Proper labeling and descriptions
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Color contrast**: WCAG compliant color schemes
- **Font scaling**: Respects user's font size preferences

## Future Scalability

The architecture supports future enhancements such as:

- Push notifications for meditation reminders
- Social features for meditation streaks
- Advanced analytics and progress tracking
- Integration with health platforms
